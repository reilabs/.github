# Reilabs

> We build software that others can't.

We've founded multi-million dollar startups, won programming competitions, and
worked with the industry leaders at FAANG companies. [See](https://reilabs.io)
what we can build with you.

Reilabs is a software consultancy specialising in solving hard problems in
complex and complicated problem domains. We do work in many areas, but we do not
limit ourselves to these.

- **High-Performance Data Processing:** Performance and reliability are critical
  for any big data application. We can suggest and implement tweaks to your
  pipeline with the potential of saving thousands of hours and millions of
  dollars in infrastructure costs.
- **Compilers and Tooling:** From the design of programming languages and
  compilers to their development and maintenance, our team has worked on many
  cutting-edge language projects over the years. Our finesse can ensure that
  your tools achieve what you want them to.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Developing software for multiple platforms is
  expensive. With our expertise in cross-platform Rust development, we can
  rapidly build your core services once, and run them natively on desktop, web,
  and mobile (iOS and Android).

If any of that sounds good to you, and you're interested in working with us,
please head to our [website](https://reilabs.io) and send us a message.
